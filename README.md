# FulltimeForce
Prueba t√©cnica

Hello, in this file I would like to introduce you to my system which shows my git commit history using the GitHub API. This project has been made, by the backend side,
using NodeJs and MongoDb, and by the frontend side, using Html(Pug), Css, and some Bootstrap.

My objective is try to demostrate to you, dear FulltimeForce team, my knowledge using as frontend as backend. Just for this case, I prefered not using some framework because,
sincerelly, my best skill on the frontend side, is focused on make a project using Html, Css, and Javascript pures. However, I could run the project using Angular and connected
with my backend to run the project.

I hosted the project on a server using DigitalOcean, MongoAtlas and Putty. You can check it in the following url: http://159.203.172.194/

Now, please, follow these steps to run my project:

1. Clone this repository on your desktop using "git clone https://github.com/Ferjomagra/FulltimeForce.git".
2. Open a console and using "cd", put the file route, or just drag and drop it on your console. For example: "cd C:\Users\ferjo\Desktop\FulltimeForce".
3. Inside the "FulltimeForce" file, you will find the "server" file. You must enter to this file using "cd server".
4. Install "node_modules" again using "npm install" on your console. This step is very important because "node_modules" file has been saved inside a ".gitignore" file.
5. Now, to run the project you need to write the following command: "npm run dev". It will be running on port 8080.
6. The project needs MongoDB, so you need to run this programe on your local machine. For example, I can running this database using the following command "mongod".
7. Now the project would be ready to run and test the git commit history.

Limitations:
- This project does not run on real time.
- Is not running with any framework on the frontend side.
- The data could be repeated.

Scopes:
- The project is in order, easy to use and to understand.
- Is using the GitHub API which has been integrated with NodeJs.
- Practical model database which can show you the main information.

Best regards!
Fer:)
